Computer Science Student at Texas State University with a specialization in full-stack development and business functions. 2 years as IT Student Representative and College of Science & Engineering Student Senator. Current SWE Intern @ Dell Technologies.

As a Junior at Texas State University studying for a B.S Computer Science (minor in Data Analytics), I have a unique balance of technical skills with practical experience covering the full-stack level of development with C++, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, C#, and Python. Software engineering comes as a fun hobby to me. Being able to make my hobby a career and develop efficient and innovative solutions for real-world challenges is a dream come true. 

Throughout my studies and projects, I have integrated Agile & SCRUM practices into my team projects that improve productivity by 20% and encourages continuous development. I am skilled in API integration, software architecture, data analytics, and human-computer interaction (HCI). I continuously seek to expand my knowledge in areas like cloud computing (AWS, Azure), computer vision, artificial intelligence.

---SPECIALTIES---

✔️ Full-Stack Development: Appling C++, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, Swift, C#, and Python in multiple projects such as Danddy, and Youngin Budgeting.

✔️ API Integration: Utilizing REST APIs and Open APIs to streamline program development.

✔️ Software Architecture: Constructing programs allowing easy adaptation to future additions using SOLID design principles to maximize efficiency.

✔️ Technical Project Management: Aligns product vision with technical execution; communicates between development teams and stakeholders via Git & Jira for PMO.

✔️ Agile Development Practices: Collaborating within Agile teams using SCRUM environments to facilitate higher team cohesion and communication.

✔️ Team Collaboration: Focusing on team morale by fostering high spirits within the team because higher morale makes a happier team driving results in better productivity.


Right now, my focus is on commencing an internship with Dell Technologies in the Summer of 2025, but I am willing to broaden my scope across different industries and geographies. I love networking and talking to new people about anything from technological advancements to professional development. Don’t hesitate to connect!
